                    <p>
                        I am Devon Gay, a senior Computer Science student at
                        Southern Connecticut State University with three years
                        of experience in SCSU's IT department. I specialize in
                        technical systems management, software and hardware
                        support, and data management, ensuring seamless
                        operations for students and faculty. With strong
                        problem-solving skills, I optimize IT processes and
                        educate users on best practices.

                        <br />
                        Beyond tech, I am passionate about continuous learning,
                        playing bass, and literature. This portfolio highlights
                        my expertise and some of my projects ive worked on
                        during my time at SCSU—I look forward to connecting!

                            Developed a dynamic web-based dice game using
                            JavaScript and Css. In this game, players place
                            chips on blocks and roll dice to delete blocks with
                            chips on them. This project involved creating an
                            interactive user interface with responsive design
                            elements, implementing game logic for dice rolling
                            and chip management and ensuring a seamless user
                            experience, this game showcases my ability in
                            front-end development, problem solving skills, and
                            ability to create engaging we applications.

                            Created a <b>Java</b> number guessing game where
                            users try to guess a randomly generated number
                            within a set range. Tracks attempts and calculates
                            the average number of guesses. A great introduction

                            This Java program allows users to enter a word and
                            searches for occurrences of that word within a
                            structured text, identifying the chapters where it
                            appears. It processes the text by chapter and scans
                            for the given word, returning a list of relevant
                            chapters.
